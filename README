2. Usage

./fuzz2sql.py <windows executable>

3. How it works

The fuzz2sql script will break apart a PE File (typically .exe's and .dll's) into their sections (i.e.: .data, .text, .rdata, etc.) and perform Context Triggered Piecewise Hasing (fuzzy hash). It will store the results in an sqlite database, as well as print to the screen.

PE files feed to the program will be referenced by their md5. It is suggested to build some metholodolgy to refer back to PE files by their md5.
